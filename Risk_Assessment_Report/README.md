NIST 800-30 Risk Management for Financial Systems
Conducted comprehensive risk assessment for university financial application system managing sensitive financial, HR, and payroll data.
Methodology:

Applied NIST 800-30 Revision 1 framework
Performed IT system characterization and boundary analysis
Identified vulnerabilities across physical, logical, and administrative controls
Determined likelihood and impact of identified risks
Developed risk mitigation strategies with prioritized controls

Critical Findings:

Outdated password configurations increasing brute-force attack risk
Non-periodic user access reviews enabling sustained unauthorized access
Delayed termination of inactive accounts creating insider threat vectors
Single-point backup failure risk from on-premises-only storage
BYOD policy gaps expanding attack surface

Recommended Controls:

Zero-trust security architecture implementation
Automated workflow and access review systems
Strong password policies with MFA enforcement
Off-site backup infrastructure
Enhanced IDS/IPS with network traffic monitoring
Role-based and attribute-based access controls

Risk Rating: High impact, high likelihood vulnerabilities identified across Tier 1-3 systems
